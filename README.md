# Password-Keep
Passwords are hard to remember sometimes, so why not just remember one? Answer: security. Password keep is a solution to using one password more securely. 

# How do I use it?
First, you come up with a 'base password'. This is a secure password that is unique, but you remember it because come on, its only a couple characters. From there, you define an "algorithm" to manipulate that password for a given website. This makes your password slightly different for each website, and thus secure, while you still are able to re-create each website's password.

# WHY!?!
Yeah, this is a pretty useless app. But that's not why I made it. It has a small language (i don't know what else to call it, but it isn't turing complete) that can parse 2 input strings and create an output string. Check out the com.wylder.passwordkeep.algorithm package to see the meat of the project.
